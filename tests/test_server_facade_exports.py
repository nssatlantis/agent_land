"""Regression guard: server facade must keep its public re-exports.

If server/__init__.py is ever committed with its re-export surface deleted
(the same "file-gutted-on-push" failure class that hit db in PR #425,
+2/-346, and schema.sql in PR #423, +3/-933), this test fails immediately
and locally instead of waiting for the viewer, `uvicorn server:app`, or the
importlib tool loader to break at runtime.

server.py was split into the server/ package (PR #434), following the
github/ pattern from PR #405. Like db, server/__init__.py is a facade that
re-exports the public API, so it needs the same ratchet as PR #431.

This guard checks the facade two ways:
  1. Statically (primary, side-effect-free) -- parse server/__init__.py and
     require every EXPECTED name to appear in a `from server... import ...`
     re-export line. This targets the gutting failure class directly (it is a
     text deletion) WITHOUT importing the whole app stack (Starlette app, 140
     tools, viewer, poller, ci_runner), so it cannot be masked by an unrelated
     import-time crash and stays fast.
  2. Dynamically (secondary) -- `import server` and require the same names to
     be present AND to point at the real leaf objects (not a placeholder or a
     renamed stand-in). This also confirms the facade actually imports.

If a name is legitimately removed or renamed from the facade, update EXPECTED
to match -- that is the contract. Do NOT delete expectations to silence the
test. Pins the 18 newly re-exported names (plus the repo_search
exclusion guard below); EXPECTED remains a representative slice, not the
full 139-name surface.

Part of the #163 resilience ratchet applied to the source tree itself.
